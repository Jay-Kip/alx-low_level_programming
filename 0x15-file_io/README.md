Project on File I/O

	#NB
C can handle files as:
1. stream-oriented data file - data is stored as it appears on the screen(I/O operations like buffering, conversions take place automatically). 
2. System-oriented data file - Data files are more closely associated with the OS and data is stored in memory without being converted to text format

	#Major operations are
1. Reading from file.
2. Opnening  a file.
3. Processing a file.
4. Writting to a file.
5. Closing a file

	#Steps are:
1. Declare a file pointer variable.
2. Open a file using fopen();.
3. Process the file.
4. Close the file using fclose();

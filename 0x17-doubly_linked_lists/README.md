Priject of double linked lists.
-> Unlike a single linked list, a double linked list has one data field and two pointers
-> One pointer points to the nexr node and the other pointer points to the previous node.
-> Just like the single linked lis, a struct is used to create a node.
-> The left pointer of the head node points to NULL and the left pointer of the last node points to NULL.
-> A double linked list can be traversed both forward and backwards
